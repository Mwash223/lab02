    <h1>Maliks' Bio</h1>
    <p> My name is Malik aw you may know. My birtday is September 9th yes I am a virgo.<br>
        Recent jobs I had until this point is MetroPcs, FedEx, and Professional Lawn Care.<br>
        I had my ups and downs like everyone else, but I loved the lawn service the most.<br>
        I'm now in CodeCrew trying to make my dreams into reality of being a <strong>Great</strong> coder.<br>
        I believe this is a great group of people I'm working with and would highly recommend it to every who wants to code.<br>
        Trust me though it's seriously a bootcamp it is tough for me, but I'm trying to roll with the punches.<br>
